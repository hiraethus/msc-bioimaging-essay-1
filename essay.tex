\section{Introduction}
In \citeyear{hamilton2014digital}, \citeauthor{hamilton2014digital} write in a review article about the success we 
will see in the world of pathology of digital pathology. It was predicted in the 1980s and the 1990s that the field of 
pathology would be revolutionised by computer driven Image Analysis (IA) becoming a routine intervention in diagnosis 
of disease \parencite{hamilton2014digital}. However, this did not transpire. As an example, the method employed 
at analysing histological tissues in the fields of research, pharmacology and in the diagnosis of disease by clinicians is 
by visual inspection the tissue \parencite{kriete2005automated}.

While the community as yet have been underwhelmed by progress in this field, the progress made in virtual microsopy 
means that we can now scan large numbers of image data which can be analysed using quantitative digital imaging 
software \parencite{mccavigan2012digital}.

% Discuss why this is changing...

\paragraph{Outline}
This article attempts to give a short outline of whether it is conceivable for digital pathology, through specific 
application of computer vision with medical imaging, to make the role of the doctor increasingly redundant.

\section{Adoption of Digital Pathology}

According to \citeauthor{dabbs2013diagnostic}, Image Analysis has seen increasing adoption in medical research, 
however, limited adoption has been seen in clinical practice, not least due to the stringent guidelines screening 
process needed for these software to be adopted \parencite[Chapter~23]{dabbs2013diagnostic}.
